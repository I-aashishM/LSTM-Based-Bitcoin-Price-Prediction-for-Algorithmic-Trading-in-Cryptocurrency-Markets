# LSTM-Based-Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-for-Algorithmic-Trading-in-Cryptocurrency-Markets

# Objective
The project's objective is to develop a predictive model using LSTM neural networks to forecast Bitcoin's closing price in USD. This model aims to assist cryptocurrency traders and investors by providing insights for making informed decisions on buying, selling, or holding Bitcoin, ultimately optimizing trading outcomes, mitigating financial risks, and capitalizing on market opportunities. The project involves gathering historical data, developing the LSTM model, and evaluating its performance, with potential enhancements like sentiment analysis to improve prediction accuracy.
